Car Sales system is an application that computerizes the conventional car sale procedure which      \
we are aware of. This is a Java/Spring/HTML based application (NO REACT). This helps in managing     >>>> HTML/CSS (FRONT-END) -> JAVA (SCRIPTED BACKEND) -> SPRING ?? (BACK-END) -> (DATABASE)
data related to buyers and sellers of the cars. Business reports can also be generated and viewed.  /

This program should handle a new and used vehicles inventory with minimum 10 cars. Every detail     
of a vehicle like manufacturer name, date of purchase, Kilometers run( in case of used vehicles), 	
price, make/model, car description picture/s of the car etc.										

X >> If a user click to view details of a car we should display the car details :eg name, model, year build, price, description, picture, etc...
X >> If a car is sitting in inventory for more than 120 days, there should be an option to place a bid on the car.            
O >> Bidding cars can be sold at a discounted price up to 10% if and only if the dealership's purchase date is over 120 days.  
X >> The inventory should have a minimum 3 cars with idle days of 120+.										 
O >> The inventory should have an option to replenish the inventory by adding pictures and details of a car.
O >> The application should have a reporting section which displays information about all transactions made, including the person who purchased the car. 
O >> This reporting page should order transactions by date starting with the most recent purchase.
O >> A user should also be able to search for a type (model) car from the inventory.
O >> The inventory should only have cars available to be sold. If a car has been sold the inventory should reflect this behavior. 

Note:
This system should have a storage of all sale transactions (save records in db).
You are required to upload your project on github, then submit your github project url.

Bonus:
Add functionality to add a new car to the inventory including a display photo of the car.
